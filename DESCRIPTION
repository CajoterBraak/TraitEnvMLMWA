Description: This package grew out of the paper New robust weighted averaging- and model-based methods for assessing trait-environment relationships (Methods in Ecology and Evolution). The model-based methods are GLMMs, here called multi-level models (MLM), of which the novel MLM3 outperforms all existing methods. MLM3 has up to 30% more power, but the WA-methods are 500 times faster than MLM3. The main function for WA-methods is CWMSNC_regressions. The main functions for MLM3 are make_obj_for_traitenv, expand4glmm and MLM3_p_max.
